# TO DO:

* change all generator functions to take desired length as input argument
* generalize total_overlay to take an arbitrary number of textures as input

### For slow movt:

* fade_3 into texture_2/p_1_diffusion or texture_1/p_4_diffusion OR MOST LIKELY extended p_6_diffusion_1
* that into texture_2/i_1_interpolation?
